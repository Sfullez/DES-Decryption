# DES-Decryption
Mid-term assignment developed using the OpenMP C framework to decrypt passwords using the DES algorithm given a password dictionary.
The only argument required by this program is the number of runs for each password, to get a mean time of execution and avoid spikes of load on the CPU.

    ./OpenMP_version [number of runs]
